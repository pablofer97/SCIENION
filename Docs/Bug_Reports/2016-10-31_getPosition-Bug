When using the beanshell script:

  //Tried this random stuff
  //mmc.setFocusDevice("yAxis");
  //mmc.waitForDevice("yAxis");
  //gui.sleep(10);

  yStartPosUm = mmc.getPosition("yAxis");
  gui.message("Y start pos: " +  yStartPosUm);

It has to be run twice in order to update for the actual current position of the stage.  I have tried a lot of workarounds, and I think the problem is possibly the drivers Derin wrote, so we'll check that out tomorrow,

FIX: 

(1) Only operate stages with software, so the communication between the drivers and the stage is not compromised OR (2) write a homing function for the stages.
